Survey on driver monitoring inside a car.
======
We are carrying out a short survey to assess how many people are comfortable with a camera (video/still) capturing images inside a car.  Additionally, we are also interested to know how many people are comfortable to wear sensors while driving. This will help us understand if any alternatives are necessary to monitor individuals inside a car. There are only 8 multiple-choice questions and the whole process should not take more than 2 minutes. Please choose the most suitable option for all the questions. The information collected is will be used for research purposes and only in anonymous form.  We declare that the collected data will be treated with complete confidentiality. For further queries, kindly direct your emails to arghasen10@gmail.com. We genuinely thank you for your time and cooperation.
