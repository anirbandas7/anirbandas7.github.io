## 2024: 

**IPSN Conference Visit**

Attended the **CPS-IoT Week** in Hong Kong and had the exciting opportunity to present our paper **MARS** at the **ACM/IEEE IPSN 2024** conference. Along with the paper presentation, we also showcased a **live demo**, engaging with researchers, academics, and industry professionals from around the world.

It was an incredible experience discussing our work with fellow attendees. The insightful feedback and thought-provoking conversations enriched our understanding and provided new directions for future research.

Here's a teaser of the paper if you missed the presentation: [MARS Paper Teaser](https://lnkd.in/dBr6r7RR)
