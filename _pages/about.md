title: "About Me"
excerpt: "I am currently an Assistant Professor. I have completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Guwahati, India. Post Ph.D., I have worked as a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the Ubiquitous Networked Systems Lab (UbiNet) at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. 

My research interest primarily involves Sensing, Human-Computer Interaction, Acoustic sensing, and the Internet of Things. My earlier research works addressed in-network data fusion, machine inference on low-power devices, sentiment analysis on textual data, and detecting communities in social networks. Apart from that, I have 5+ years of teaching experience both abroad and within the country.
