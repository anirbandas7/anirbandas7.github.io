[SMART: Streamlining Meta-expertise through Advanced AI and Rapid Technology](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/d/e/1FAIpQLSdMT7ioXKX3iD_WDh2VdwihHCP-xKWJXg7Qo_SsddaPdQWksg/closedform)

Launched the first round of SMART. In today's fast-paced digital era, the demand for software applications has surged, leading to a growing need for rapid application development. Low-code and no-code (LCNC) have emerged as powerful tools that allow individuals to create software applications with minimal coding effort. The advantages of LCNC platforms include drag-and-drop visual interfaces, progressive deployment of web applications across various form factors and experiences, API-based integration with external and enterprise applications and data, and business process modeler and automation workflow designer using AI-based approaches. These platforms help convert business ideas into minimal viable products without spending significant effort on coding. These platforms also aid in testing the potential of business ideas, thus reducing massive costs and risks associated with software product development. 

Recognizing the significance of these platforms in modern software development, NIIT University planned a contest for developing AI-based Applications with the LCNC Challenge.  Low-code technologies make engaging with code simple for developers and non-developers. Developers with some programming skills can speed up automation initiatives. Non-developers can also design forms, data-collection applications, business procedures, and custom user interfaces for customers using little code.
