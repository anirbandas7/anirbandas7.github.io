With the widespread adoption of IoT infrastructure, contemporary smart applications transcend the confines of a singular domain. Whether within the boundaries of a home environment or spanning across a city-scale infrastructure, multiple smart applications and their associated services collaborate on a shared sensing platform to cater to users' needs. The primary motivation behind this shared infrastructure is to minimize installation and maintenance costs, but it also facilitates rapid cross-domain inference. This means that a common set of data, such as room temperature and CO2 density, can simultaneously inform occupancy estimation services, feeding into HVAC systems, surveillance systems, and smart resource management systems concurrently.

To achieve faster decision-making and automation, it is crucial to preprocess sensory data at the network edge. However, current simulation platforms fail to accurately capture the real-world dynamics that impact the performance of edge-based sensing and data processing solutions within a shared IoT infrastructure. We therefore develop a testbed to assess the performance of such edge-based solutions, specifically in supporting ambient living.
