Project Overview

{: .align-center}

The project titled “AI-based On-road Context Assessment” has been supported under the New Faculty Seed Grant (NFSG) program of BITS Pilani, with a sanctioned amount of ₹20,00,000. The grant provides resources to initiate independent research in computer vision with a focus on practical, real-world challenges.

This study aims to observe and understand diverse on-road environments, particularly within Indian traffic and weather conditions, which often present unique and dynamic scenarios. The project involves both laboratory-based experiments and field data collection, supported by equipment such as high-resolution cameras, portable computing units, and environmental sensors.

The objective is to explore systematic ways to interpret visual and contextual cues from these real-world settings, contributing toward safer and more informed on-road assessment practices. Specific technical details are intentionally withheld to protect the originality of the research approach.

I gratefully acknowledge the support of BITS Pilani through the NFSG initiative, which has made this initiative possible.
