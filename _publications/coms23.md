permalink: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.08188.pdf
excerpt: 'Continuous monitoring of driver attentiveness inside a car has been of significant importance for quite some time. However, the state of the art techniques are primarily inclined toward image based data, which is invasive and, therefore, could pose challenges in the pervasive adoption of such a system. This work proposes a novel approach for continuous driver attentiveness monitoring, leveraging millimeter Wave (mmWave) sensing to address that. The sensing infrastructure is compact, lightweight, and bears the exclusive potential to be adopted in a pervasive manner due to the continuously increasing popularity of mmWave hardware with 5G technology. We study the driver's attention as a multi class problem and address that using Range Doppler information from an mmWave radar. We evaluate the proposed methodologies in a lab and a real world driving scenario. Within the lab-based setup, we achieved an accuracy of 88%, whereas, in the real world system, we could achieve an accuracy of up to 79% while monitoring the driver's activities associated with driving attentiveness.'
