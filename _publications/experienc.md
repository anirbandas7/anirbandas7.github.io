excerpt: 'With ubiquitous adaptation of IoT infrastructure, the smart applications these days are not confined within a single realm. Be it the boundary of a home environment or a city-scale infrastructure, multiple smart applications and associated services tend to serve the users by sharing a common sensing platform. Although the very purpose of this shared infrastructure motivates from the reduced installation and maintenance expenses, it offers a great deal in enabling faster cross-domain inference too. For instance, the same data reflecting room temperature and CO 2 density can be taken into consideration by occupancy estimation service to feed the HVAC system, surveillance system as well as smart resource management system concurrently. Towards faster decision-making and automation it is imperative that the sensory data be pre-processed at the network edge. Now, the existing simulation platforms cannot account for the real-world dynamics affecting the performance of such edge-based sensing and data processing solutions for a shared IoT infrastructure. This work aims to document the practical lessons learnt while developing a testbed to evaluate the performance of such edge-based solutions to support ambient living. Along with the detailed description of system architecture, requirement analysis, design and development arrangement, we also provide a use case demonstration to unfold the inherent challenges and potential solution ideas to setup and conduct experiments on such a testbed environment.'
